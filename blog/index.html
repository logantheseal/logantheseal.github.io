                        <p>Captain. Yes, sir? Tell them we wish to board at once. With all due respect, the Ambassadors for the Supreme Chancellor wish to board immediately. Yes, yes, of course, as you know, our blockade is perfectly legal, and we'd be happy to receive the Ambassador. I'm TC-14 at your service. This way, please.
                        The hyperdrive is leaking. We'll have to land somewhere to refuel and repair the ship. Here, Master. Tatooine, It's small, out of the way, poor.
                        Thank you for your help. We leave in peace. Master, what's a bongo? A transport, I hope. Daza setten yousa up.</p>
                        <p>I think you have, why else would you be here? I can see there's no fooling you, We're on our way to Coruscant, the central system in the Republic, on a very important mission. How did you end up here in the outer rim? Our ship was damaged, and we're stranded here until we can repair it. I can help! I can fix anything! I believe you can, but first we must acquire the parts we need. Wit no-nutten mula to trade. These junk dealers must have a weakness of some kind.
                        I move for a vote of no confidence. in Chancellor Valorum's leadership. Vote now! Vote now! Vote now! Order! Now they will elect a new Chancellor, a strong Chancellor, one who will not let our tragedy continue. The boy will not pass the Council's tests, Master. I foresee you will become a great Jedi Knight. Dare-sa nobody dare. Da Gungan city is diserted. Some kinda fight, mesa tinks. Look at all the money we have! Oh, my goodness, That's wonderful Ani. And Anakin has been freed. What?!? You're no longer a slave. Did you hear that? Now you can make your dreams come true, Annie. You're free! (turns to Qui-Gon) Will you take him with you? Is he to become a Jedi? Yes.</p>               
                    <h3>Hello There!</h3>
                    <!-- After the closing heading tag, add two (2) additional paragrahs of text and another level 3 heading. -->
                        <p>Noooo! No given up General Ja Ja. Wesa tink of sometin. Hands up! My giv up. My giv up. Your little insurrection is at an end, Your Highness. But not at the expense of the moment. Be mindful of the living Force, my young Padawan. Yes, Master. How do you think the trade viceroy will deal with the chancellor's demands? These Federation types are cowards. The negotiations will be short. I do not believe the Sith could have returned without us knowing. Ah, hard to see, the dark side is. We will use all our resources here to unravel this mystery and discover the identity of your attacker. May the Force be with you. Dis seem uverly. How will you explain this invasion to the Senate? The Queen and I will sign a treaty that will legitimize our occupation here. I assurances it will be ratified by the Senate. I will not co-operate. Ani! I'm not going to tell you again! What are you doing? Checking your blood for infections. You have a big day tomorrow. Goodnight. Obi-Wan.</p>
                        <p>Has anyone been to them all? Not likely. I want to be the first one to see them all. Annie, bedtime! Ouch! There we are, good as new. Ani! I'm not going to tell you again! What are you doing? Checking your blood for infections. You have a big day tomorrow. Goodnight. Obi-Wan. Don't touch anything. Are you an angel? What? An angel. I've heard the deep space pilots talk about them. They are the most beautiful creatures in the universe. My only conclusion can be that it was a Sith Lord. Impossible! The Sith have been extinct for a millenium. I do not believe the Sith could have returned without us knowing. Ah, hard to see, the dark side is. Had he been born in the Republic, we would have identified him early. The Force is unusually strong with him, that much is clear. Who is his father? There was no father. I carried him, I gave birth, I raised him, I can't explain what happened.</p>

                        <p>Credits will do fine. No, they won'ta. What you think you're some kinda Jedi, waving your hand around like that? I'm a Toydarian. Mind tricks don'ta work on me-only money. Dissen cozy. These are my friends, Mom. Hidoe! I'm Qui-Gon Jinn. I'm building a droid. You wanna see? Your son was kind enough to offer us shelter. Come on! I'll show you Threepio! Isn't he great?! He's not finished yet. my loyal bodyguard, I am sorry for my deception, but it was necessary to protect myself. Although we do not always agree, Your Honor, our two great societies have always lived in peace. The Trade Federation has destroyed all that we have worked so hard to build. If we do not act quickly, all will be lost forever. I ask you to help us. (PADME drops to her knees before the GUNGANS.). I fear by the time you have control of the bureaucrats, Senator, there will be nothing left of our our people, our way of life. I understand your concern, Your Majesty; unfortunately, the Federation has possession of our planet. Senator, this is your arena. I feel I must return to mine.</p>
                        <p>Unlock one-five-seven and nine. Release charges. There's no one on board, sir. According to the log, the crew abandoned ship right after takeoff. It must be a decoy, sir. Several of the escape pods have been jettisoned. Did you find any droids? No, sir. I seem to have found it. General Kenobi, years ago you served my father in the Clone Wars. Now he begs you to help him in his struggle against the Empire. I regret that I am unable to present my father's request to you in person, but my ship has fallen under attack and I'm afraid my mission to bring you to Alderaan has failed. I have placed information vital to the survival of the Rebellion into the memory systems of this R2 unit. My father will know how to retrieve it. You must see this droid safely delivered to him on Alderaan. This is it! We should be able to see it by now. Keep your eyes open for those fighters! There's too much interference! Red Five, can you see them from where you are? No sign of any...wait! Coming in point three five. I see them. I'm in range. In my experience, there's no such thing as luck. Look, going good against remotes is one thing. Going good against the living? That's something else. Looks like we're coming up on Alderaan. You know, I did feel something.</p>
                        <p>Bring them on! I prefer a straight fight to all this sneaking around. We found the computer outlet, sir. Plug in. He should be able to interpret the entire Imperial computer network. This is our most desperate hour. Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi, you're my only hope. You must learn the ways of the Force if you're to come with me to Alderaan. Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I've got to go home. It's late, I'm in for it as it is. I need your help, Luke. This is madness! We're doomed! There'll be no escape for the Princess this time. What's that? Artoo! Artoo-Detoo, where are you? At last! Where have you been? They're heading in this direction. What are we going to do? We'll be sent to the spice mine of Kessel or smashed into who knows what! Wait a minute, where are you going? The Death Star plans are not in the main computer. Where are those transmissions you intercepted? What have you done with those plans? We intercepted no transmissions. I regret that I am unable to present my father's request to you in person, but my ship has fallen under attack and I'm afraid my mission to bring you to Alderaan has failed. I have placed information vital to the survival of the Rebellion into the memory systems of this R2 unit. My father will know how to retrieve it. You must see this droid safely delivered to him on Alderaan.></p>
